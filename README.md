## Description

An Ansible setup for my home Linux machine running Nobara, intended as a general purpose gaming machine and an API server specifically for ML tasks (my Hetzner VPS will receive all calls first and only redirect if ML tasks are needed since it runs 24/7). 

Run this after completing the initial "welcome" setup, which includes updating, setting up NVIDIA drivers, and installing other codecs.
